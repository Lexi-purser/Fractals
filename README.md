# Fractal Generator GUI – CS 3005: Programming in C++

This repository contains programs and files from my **CS 3005: Programming in C++** course.  
The primary project is a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** that allows users to generate and explore various fractals.

---

## 🌀 Features

The application supports:
- Fractal visualization and exploration
- Zoom in/out functionality
- Color model conversion (RGB ↔ HSV)
- Fractal type switching (Mandelbrot, Julia, ComplexFractal)
- Dynamic grid control and view navigation

## 🎮 Controls

| Key / Action        | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `T`                 | Switch to color table interaction mode |
| `t`                 | Switch to fractal interaction mode |
| `>` or `.`          | Increase color table size |
| `<` or `,`          | Decrease color table size |
| `b`                 | Switch to Mandelbrot fractal |
| `n`                 | Switch to Julia fractal |
| `F`                 | Switch to ComplexFractal |
| Mouse Click         | Set Julia parameters `a` and `b` (only in Mandelbrot mode) |
| `z`                 | Zoom in on the complex plane |
| `Z`                 | Zoom out on the complex plane |
| Arrow Keys (←↑↓→)   | Move view in respective directions |
| `R`                 | Reset complex plane to `[-2, 2]` range in both axes |
| `+` or `=`          | Increase maximum grid value |
| `-`                 | Decrease maximum grid value |
| `h`                 | Convert between RGB and HSV |

## 📘 Course Information: CS 3005 – Programming in C++

**Status:** ✅ Completed with Credit

### 📚 Course Description
Designed for Computer Science and IT majors, or students with prior programming experience.  
Focuses on the syntax and semantics of **C++**, taught through hands-on programming projects.

### 🏆 Course Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion, students are able to:
1. Construct programs in C++ using functions, classes, and STL.
2. Work with memory types: stack, heap, and static.
3. Program in a statically typed language.
4. Design and implement unit tests.
5. Use version control (e.g., Git) effectively.
6. Utilize debugging and memory-checking tools.
7. Build larger-scale applications than in previous coursework.
